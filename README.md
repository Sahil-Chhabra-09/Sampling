# Sampling

Performed ML model comparison on an imbalanced Dataset containing two classes 0 and 1 with frequencies as: 763 and 9 respectively denoting legit and fradulent transaction using various sampling techniques

Steps Performed:
1. EDA
2. Data Balancing through OverSampling
3. Calculation of sample size using sample detection formula
4. Taking samples through different techniques (simple random, stratified, ...)
5. Pipeling different models for comparison on each sample
